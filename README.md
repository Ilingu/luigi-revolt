## 🤖 AutoCleaner Bot 🌐

[Invite Link](https://app.revolt.chat/bot/01GBAXECGEDY60EKCABPYZZBVW)

🧹 Clean your server. This BOT automatically erase Images/Attachments after a specified amount of time after their creation.

### 📖 Usage:

1. [Add AC to ur server](https://app.revolt.chat/bot/01GBAXECGEDY60EKCABPYZZBVW)
2. That's it! Now all your image will be deleted **5 days** after their creation
   - if you want to change the expire time type: `ac!time <new time in millisecond>` (e.g: 5 days = _432000000_ ms)
   - Normally all the channel accessible by autocleaner are indexed automatically (when bot first joined the server and at channel creation). if by some reason the bot doesn't work type `ac!index` in the channel, if AC doesn't reply that mean it can't access the channel because of its **permissions**.
